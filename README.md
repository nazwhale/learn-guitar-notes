# Learn Guitar Notes

I've always meant to memorize all the notes on the neck of a guitar, but never got round to it. I reckon it'll be pretty useful in learning to apply music theory.

This app aims to help me (and the rest of the world) to do that.

It's also an exercise in hitting MVP fast and iterating in the smallest steps possible.

Design-wise I'm going to resist making any design decisions until I encounter problems that I wish to solve through design (rather than putting pretty colours on for the sake of it - something I've been guilty of in the past! ðŸ™ˆ).
